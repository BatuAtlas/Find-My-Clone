This project is a backend clone of the Apple FindMy app.

There isn't FindMy app on android, so i made one. Only the interface design remains. â€” i'm not a designer :c
    I'm open to any kind of help with interface design.

Goals on the backend side:

- [ ] Built a client app :zap:
- [ ] Create a Dockerfile for installation
- [ ] Implement end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for GPS data
